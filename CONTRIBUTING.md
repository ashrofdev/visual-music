# Contributing to Visual Music

## First steps
__Wanted : leader team!__
* tech lead (whose first task would be to help setting the most relevant stack for the project, as well as a global architecture; and help structuring and sequencing the project tasks in time)
* design lead that would ensure the design of a beautiful graphical charter, and its respect thereafter
* code quality manager to check the code for issues before a PR can be merged
* PR reviewers (checking the comment is documented, the README.md is updated, absence of conflicts, etc.) before merging

__Wanted: contributors!__      
Does the project appeal to you? Contact us on Discord and we'll provide the link to the __Trello board__! :)

When contributing to this repository, check the Trello board for available tasks. If the task is:
* __Available__: Go ahead and *claim the task*, and proceed to work on a PR
* __Claimed__: If someone else has claimed the task, speak with them or one of the project admin. *PRs will only be accepted from the person that claimed that task.*
* __Non-Existant__: If the feature does not appear on trello, *discuss it on Discord or speak with a project admin*.

The above is to ensure, everyone has the chance to get involved without waiting their time or rushing to add the feature.

Please also note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/visual-music/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Visual Music Process
### Staging Area
If you have an idea, suggestion or have found a bug in the project. Create a task with a detailed description, if it's a bug add photo, and steps on how to replicate it. We'll then discuss it in the task comment section or on Discord. If its approved by the community it will be added to the __Tasks/Todos__ area. You can also assign yourself to the task, that way nobody could work on that task but you if its approved.

### Tasks/Todos
This is where you can find available tasks! If you are looking for a new challenge, select a task that excites you, assign yourself to it and move it into the __In Progress__ area.
NOTE: Don't take tasks that have already been assigned to someone, without their or a project admin approval.

### In Progress
This is where tasks that are being worked on belong. Drag your task into this section, when you start working on it.
NOTE: Always create a new branch when working on a task!

### Review
This is where tasks are place whilst the PR has been submitted and is awaiting approval. Once the code has been reviewed, it will be merged and the task can be moved into the __Done__ section.

### Done
Tasks that have been completed, reviewed and merged can be found in this section.


## CONTRIBUTING
We use Trello for task management. If you want to contribute, contact a project admin through Discord, an invitation to join the team on Trello we'll be given to you. Feel free to write the team some lines so the contributors get to know each other, add your name on the CONTRIBUTORS.md list and... you're good to go! 

## Working on Code
* Pick a listed task from the __Tasks/Todos__ area, assign it to yourself by editing your name into the card
* Or create a card on the __Staging Area__, you can as well claim it once approved, and start working on it
* If you want to work on an ongoing task, get permission from the person whose task is assigned to
* Start a new branch or fork and start coding
* Always let others in Discord know what you are working on

## Adding Library
If you have any library that you want to use, please discuss it with the team first, as we want to avoid using different libraries that do the same thing.
