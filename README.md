## Visual Music WebApp
An app that converts your favorite music pieces into visual expressions. 

Visual Music wishes to become a collaboration project managed by a group of dedicated fellow students. Aimed at all music and arts lovers, it provides the users with a real time visual transcription of a music piece uploaded. 

If the visual transcription can be at first of random assignment of colors and shapes, it shouldn't remain so, as **one of the main interest is to transcribe the emotional effects of the music piece**. Therefore, questions will araise as perception is highly cultural and language induced. It might be interesting in a second time to create various themes based on those considerations for the visual transcription.

## Applications
The applications could be :
* the possibility to screen the visual expression as background for parties, concerts and stages, 
* accessibility, by giving a visual transcription of music pieces, making them accessible to the hearing impaired,
* creation of original objects, with the possibility of a screen capture going with a downloadable HD print file, the possibility of printing, framing and offering the painting of a song to friends and family,
* tool or interesting experiment for musicologists, linguists, scientists, etc.

## Stack:
Needs to be defined with the help of more experienced developers, especially taking into account the specificities related to the conversion and analysis of audio files...

| Stack:                     |
|----------------------------|
| HTML5                      |
| CSS3 Flexbox & Grid System |
| Javascript                 |
| React + Redux              |
| Node.js + Express.js       |
| Data-Driven library        |
| Vector Graphics Scripting  |
| Stuff ^^                   |


The app could run based on grid system of 24 columns, the visual part being almost full screen (but for the necessary buttons) and with a flow from left to right. A beat could trigger the first column and its associated rows. There should be a long horizontal scrolling so the user could look at the entire music piece and not only the extract of 24 beats. The flow could also be from right to left in a second time (for right to left written languages speakers).
