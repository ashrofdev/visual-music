## Visual Music WebApp
An app that converts your favorite music pieces into visual expressions. 

Visual Music wishes to become a collaboration project managed by a group of dedicated fellow students. Aimed at all music and arts lovers, it provides the users with a real time visual transcription of a music piece uploaded. 

If the visual transcription can be at first of random assignment of colors and shapes, it shouldn't remain so, as **one of the main interest is to transcribe the emotional effects of the music piece**. Therefore, questions will araise as perception is highly cultural and language induced. It might be interesting in a second time to create various themes based on those considerations for the visual transcription.

## Applications
The applications could be :
* the possibility to screen the visual expression as background for parties, concerts and stages, 
* accessibility, by giving a visual transcription of music pieces, making them accessible to the hearing impaired,
* creation of original objects, with the possibility of a screen capture going with a downloadable HD print file, the possibility of printing, framing and offering the painting of a song to friends and family,
* tool or interesting experiment for musicologists, linguists, scientists, etc.

## Stack:
Is being defined.  

* React and Redux
* CSS3 Flexbox & Grid System
* Javascript
* Node.JS / Express
* P5 / maybe d3.JS? Maybe html5?
* Some storage solution for files: Probably Firebase?? Or AWS?
* Figma to design the UI interface?

Potential Add-On:
* [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) Will let us test components individually
